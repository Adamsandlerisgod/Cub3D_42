Objectives

The goals of this project align with the broader objectives of the first year, emphasizing rigor, proficiency in C programming, application of fundamental algorithms, and adept information research techniques.

As a graphic design project, cub3D provides an opportunity to enhance skills in diverse areas, including working with windows, manipulating colors, handling events, and implementing shape-filling operations.

In essence, cub3D serves as an exceptional platform for delving into the practical and playful applications of mathematics without necessitating an in-depth understanding of its intricacies.

Leveraging the wealth of documentation available on the internet, participants in this project will employ mathematics as a powerful tool, fostering the creation of elegant and efficient algorithms.
